## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This challenge helped me strengthen my knowledge and find new solutions.

The property that helped me solve the interaction challenge is `opacity`.

The `opacity` property is often used together with the `:hover` selector to change the opacity on mouse-over:

```css
img {
  opacity: 0.5;
}

img:hover {
  opacity: 1.0;
}
```

### Continued development

After this challenge, I think I have to practice some interactive effects.

### Useful resources

- [Opacity](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_image_transparency.asp) - The opacity property specifies the opacity/transparency of an element.
